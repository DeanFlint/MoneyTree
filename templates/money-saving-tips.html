			  <p>Wondering how to save money on your shopping? From your weekly food 
			  shop to your next gadget purchase, here are a few smart, simple, money saving tips.</p>

			    <uib-accordion-group heading="Remember your rights" is-open="status.isFirstOpen">
			      <p> As a consumer, you have the right to complain about problems with any goods or services you’ve purchased.</p>
			    </uib-accordion-group>			    
			    
			    <uib-accordion-group heading="Best ways to save money on shopping">
			     <p> For many of us, shopping takes up a large chunk of the monthly budget. Whether you’re trying to save money 
			     on food shopping, or cut the cost of buying online, we’ve pulled together a few tips to help you.</p>
			        <ul>
			          <li><p><span class=”list-titles”>Work out what you spend your money on</span>Make a list of everything you buy 
			          in a typical month. This will make it easier to work out where you can cut back.</p></li>
			          
			          <li><p><span class=”list-titles”> Shop around.</span>Check out the competition and compare prices. For example, 
			          it might be cheaper to go to a different supermarket, or buy your electronics from a different website.</p></li>
			          
			          <li><p><span class=”list-titles”> Beware of special offers.</span>Vouchers, special offers and cashback deals were 
			          invented to make you spend more, not less. Never buy something you don’t need just because it’s on offer.</p></li>
			          
			          <li><p><span class=”list-titles”> Don’t impulse buy.</span>Think carefully before making a purchase - especially if 
			          it’s expensive. At the very least sleep on it! It might seem less appealing in the morning.</p></li>
			          
			          <li><p><span class=”list-titles”> Check reviews.</span>If you’re not sure about a product, check online to see if 
			          there are any reviews. Just type its name into a search engine, followed by ‘review’.</p></li>
			        </ul>
			    </uib-accordion-group>

			    <uib-accordion-group heading="Using your credit or debit card">
			      <p> If something goes wrong, buying on your credit or debit card gives you greater protection than cash or cheque.</p>
			      <p> Credit cards offer the most protection – as long as the item or service you bought cost over &#163;100, you can claim against 
			      your card provider under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act to get your money back.</p>
			    </uib-accordion-group>
			    
			    <uib-accordion-group heading="Shopping and paying safely online">
			      <p> Online shopping is a great way to compare prices, pick up bargains and track down those hard-to-find gifts – and with a 
			      bit of know-how anyone can do it safely.</p>
			    </uib-accordion-group>
			    
			    <uib-accordion-group heading="Spend less money than you earn">
			      <p> If you earn &#163;30,000/year and you spend &#163;31,000/year, you’ll end up in a spiral of debt that’s hard to walk away from. If you 
			      spend exactly as much as you earn every year, you’ll never be prepared for emergencies or major life changes. Spending less than you earn 
			      allows you the freedom to save, to prepare for the future, and deal with the inevitable crises that life throws at you. The bigger the gap 
			      between your income and your spending, the better. </p>
